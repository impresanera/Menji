## OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

You agree that Menji does not offer transportation Services, but is rather an independent ride-hailing service Platform for processing and facilitating orders for transportation services between drivers and passengers directly with each other. Transport services are provided by drivers who are independent contractors and are not employed by Menji and who provide their services under a contract (with you) for the carriage of passengers, and the fulfillment of the contract entered into between you and the Driver is not the responsibility of Menji. The provisions of any transportation laws applicable between drivers and passengers in Nigeria shall not apply between Menji and passengers that make use of the Platform. Any disputes arising from consumer rights, legal obligations or from law applicable to the provision of transport services shall be resolved between the passengers and drivers directly.

You have the sole right to determine when, where, and for how long you will utilize the Menji Platform. Menji will make every effort to guarantee that the Menji app is only used by drivers who are honest and respectful passengers and of their profession. However, we cannot guarantee that every transport service provider found via the Menji app meets the aforementioned requirements at all times. If you have a problem with a transportation service, please contact our customer service support first.

## ORDERING AND CANCELLATION OF RIDES

When you order a transportation service and the driver agrees to embark on the trip, the service is deemed to be ordered. Once a driver confirms that he/she will complete your journey, you will enter into a separate agreement with the driver for the provision of the service on such terms and conditions as you agree with the driver.

You cancel an ordered transportation service when the driver has responded to your request for transportation service and you reject, cancel, or decline the service. If you cancel a transportation service request after a specific amount of time has passed, you may be charged a cancellation fee, except a valid reason for cancellation is given, such as where the driver is taking too long to pick you up, where the driver moved in wrong direction, where the driver tells you to cancel, where driver did not match picture on his profile, where the car did not match description, or for any other reason specified on the platform.

When the driver notifies the passenger about his arrival at the pickup location of the passenger or people for whom the transportation service was ordered, and the passenger does not arrive at the vehicle within a certain time period as specified in the Menji app, the request will be deemed canceled. When the driver arrives and gives you a notice, the Menji app may begin charging you a fee depending on the amount of time you wait, according to the rates stated in the Menji app. The free waiting period is approximately five (5) minutes, after which the app calculates any additional time the driver spends waiting until your arrival. Sometimes the driver may decide to cancel your request, please note that Menji is not responsible for such situations.

At the end of each trip, You will have the chance to review your experience and offer further comments about your driver and your overall trip experience.

If you use the Menji app to request transportation and damage the driver's car or its furnishings, for instance, by sullying or staining the vehicle or making it stink, the driver has the right to demand an adequate amount to cover for the damages and such amount shall not exceed 100,000 naira as penalty.

## PAYMENT AND FARES

Please note that we compute the distance traveled on your journey using GPS data from your Driver's phone. We cannot guarantee that GPS data will be available or accurate. If we lose signal, we'll use the data estimated from your journey to determine time and distance. Payments may be made by passengers using cash, online bank transfers or via the Menji In-App payment service (provided by a 3rd party payment processor)

Menji may quote you a fare at the time of your request, however, until the ride request is verified, the quote is subject to change. We may cancel the cost quotation and charge you a variable cost depending on the time and distance of your journey. If you alter your destination, make repeated stops, or attempt to misuse the Menji Platform during your ride, you may be charged a variable cost.

The purpose of this payment structure is to adequately reimburse the driver for the services rendered to you. All Charges are payable immediately, and Menji will process payment using the selected payment method specified in your Account, after which Menji will email you a receipt, if you opt to receive email receipts.

Menji will arrange your payment of the relevant fares, fees, payments and Charges on behalf of the driver as the driver's limited payment collection agent after you have received services through the Menji platform.

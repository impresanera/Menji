The email address for service of any legal notices is [support@menji.com](mailto:support@menji.com).

You entrust us with your personal information when you use Menji. Therefore, we are dedicated to maintaining that confidence and we understand that it begins with assisting you in comprehending our privacy policies.

Our goal at Menji is to make your life easier and better by offering the best transportation service platform in the world, to enable you to get from one point to another, as hassle-free as possible. We may need to collect, utilize, and disclose some of your personal information to do this effectively. This Privacy Policy covers both the “online” (e.g., web and mobile services) and “offline” (e.g., collection of Data through telephone or in-person) activities owned, operated, provided, and/or made available by or through us.

Please read the following statement to learn more about how we collect and disseminate information. Please be aware that our privacy policies are subject to change at any time and maybe without notice. Please examine this policy regularly to ensure you are informed of any changes.

## **1. TO WHOM DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO**

This policy applies to all users of Menji’s services, including those who use the Menji app, website, features, or other services, regardless of where they may be located, such as Drivers (including driver applicants who have not completed their registration process) and passengers. Unless it is indicated that a separate privacy policy will apply to a specific service, feature, or geographical area, this privacy policy shall apply to all users of the Menji Platform.

## **2. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

The information we collect from users may broadly be classified into three, namely:

- Those provided by users at the point of signing up or registration
- Information we collect when you use the Menji platform.
- Information we collect from 3rd parties.

### **2.1. Information Provided by Users**

When users create or update their Menji accounts, we collect information such as their name, email, phone number, username, and password, address (you may choose to specify either home or work), demographic data such as gender, age, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), driver’s license and other government-issued identity documents (which may indicate a document number as well as the date of birth, gender, and photo of the user). Information such as car insurance details, driving history or criminal record, emergency contact information, user settings, and proof of medical fitness to provide services while using the Menji platform may also be required.

We also record all of the information users offer in their feedback when they rate and provide feedback on trips, Passengers, Drivers, and the way the App or service works. We collect whatever information is supplied when users contact us or we contact users, including the contents of any messages or attachments sent to us through our customer support.

### **2.2. Information we collect when you use the Menji platform**

**Location data**: GPS and location data is so integral to the functioning of the ride-hailing service, therefore, users may need to grant device permissions to enable us to access their current location to ensure optimal performance of our services. Users can turn off their device’s GPS and other location-tracking features, however, a user who deactivates his or her device’s GPS or location data may not be able to optimise Menji’s services, and if such a user is a driver, he or she would not be allowed to use the Menji platform.

When you access and use the app (including while it is running in the background), we capture your device’s approximate location from the time a passenger requests a ride, until the trip ends and in the case of a driver, as long as the driver’s device is set on driver mode. This enables us to facilitate a hassle-free and accurate pick-up and destination, ensure safety, and accurate tracking to detect and prevent fraud as much as possible.

**Device Information**: Menji may also collect information about the devices used to access our services, which includes, Device identifiers such as the Device model, IP address, type of browser, operating system version, the identity of carrier and manufacturer, software, preferences, and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. We also gather mobile sensors and other technical data from devices of drivers.

**Usage Information**: We gather information regarding the use of the Menji Platform and services including ride information, like the date, time, destination, travel distance, route taken, payment method, and whether a user made use of a promotional or referral code. We also monitor user’s interactions with the Menji Platforms, (our apps and websites) including system activity like access dates and times, type of browser and the apps, website pages, and content users view on their device, as well as the dates and times they are used; and all of these data may be used for marketing purposes or determining the behavioral characteristics of users.

Cookies, tags, and other tracking technologies and data analytics that create and maintain unique identifiers are used to collect this information and make for an easier and seamless user experience. You may choose to disable cookies by changing your browser or device settings. However, this may prevent you from being able to use certain features of the Menji Services.

**Communication Data**: Through Menji’s mobile apps and websites, users may communicate with one another and with Menji. Drivers and passengers may communicate with one another by calling or texting and Menji obtains some information about the calls, messages, or other communications to provide this service, such as the date and time of the communications as well as the content of the communications. Menji may also use this information for customer service (in resolving user complaints), security, and safety, to improve our services, features, and analytics.

### **2.3. Information we collect from 3rd parties**

Some 3rd party service providers such as financial service providers, GPS and Geolocation service providers, Background check providers, insurance partners, and marketing providers, amongst others provide us with data for both essential components of the Menji Platform and additional services, programs, loyalty perks, and promotions that can improve your user experience. These 3rd party services provide us with the following information about users’:

- Menji users request services for or on behalf of other users, or when they enable such users to request or receive services through their accounts. This includes owners of Menji for Business accounts.
